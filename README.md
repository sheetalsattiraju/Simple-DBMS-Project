# Simple-DBMS-Project

To test, use g++ compiler and run db select, insert, delete, update, etc.

This DBMS will allow the user to type in simple DDL statements and build a system catalog (set of packed descriptors).  
Once the table definition is in place, the user can insert, update, delete, and select from a table.
